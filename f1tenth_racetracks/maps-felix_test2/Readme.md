# Conventions

* Save a map with a pgm and yaml file here. If name "map" used, it will be ignored by git.
* To create a csv file description of the map or an optimal raceline, go to the "racelineoptimization" repository and follow instructions there.
* The ending "_rl" means raceline and contains all the information that, e.g., a pure pursuit algorithm needs.
